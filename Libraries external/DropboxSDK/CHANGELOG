Changes from 1.3.13 to 1.3.14

- OS X SDK now mutes desktop notifications on the same machine

Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.3
- The SDK now supports uploading large files using
  -[DBRestClient uploadFileChunk:offset:fromPath:] and
  -[DBRestClient uploadFile:toPath:withParentRev:fromUploadId:]. See
  the developers site and DBRestClient.h for more information on using them.
- There is a new method, -[DBRestClient loadSharableLinkForFile:shortUrl], that
  allows you to create links that are not shortened with the db.tt url
  shortener.

  url to the app delegate.

Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2
- Fixes for building the OS X SDK using Xcode3 and on older versions of OS X
- iOS authentication now happens inside an embedded web view if the
  Dropbox app is not installed. QuartzCore is also now a required framework on
  iOS, so you'll need to add it if you don't have it yet.

Changes from 1.2 to 1.2.1
- Made DropboxOSX.framework compatible with 32-bit apps
- Added the -[DBRestClient cancelAllRequests] method
- Store all access tokens in the keychain rather than userDefaults. The SDK
  will migrate and remove existing credentials stored in your app's userDefaults

Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
- The copy and move delegate callbacks have been changed to return the metadata
  of the file copied/moved rather than just the path it was copied/moved to.
  The new delegate callbacks are named restClient:copiedPath:to: and
  restClient:movedPath:to:
- DBMetadata objects have a new field, clientMtime, which is a displayable
  time for the last time the files contents were modified.
- Added DropboxOSX.framework, an OSX compatible version of the Dropbox SDK
- -[DBRestClient loadDelta:] method added, which loads a list of metadata
  entries that have changed since the last time the method was called.
- -[DBRestClient createCopyRef] and -[DBRestClient copyFromRef:toPath:] methods
  were also added, which give you the ability to copy files between Dropboxes
  without downloading and re-uploading the file

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
- The SBJson library included in the DropboxSDK framework has been renamed to
  DBJson to prevent duplicate symbols with other libraries that use SBJson
- The loadFile and loadThumbnail APIs now support callbacks that also return
  metadata. loadFile - for the file being downloaded. loadThumbnail - for the
  file whose thumbnail is being downloaded.
- Removed email from DBAccountInfo. This field is being deprecated from the API.
  userId is the recommended way to reference an account.
- Various bug fixes

Changes from 0.3 to 1.0
- The SDK is now packaged as a framework rather than importing the source
  directly into your project. This allows the SDK to work with projects
  that are using ARC.
- Because the SDK is now a framework, you need to import DropboxSDK.h like this:
  #import <DropboxSDK/DropboxSDK.h>
- The SDK uses an all new authentication method. First, the SDK is no longer
  able to login or create accounts directly, instead you need to call link
  on the DBSession object. This will launch the official iOS app if it's
  installed, and Safari otherwise, and the user will have the option of
  approving your app for access. See the Authentication guide on
  https://www.dropbox.com/developers for more details.
- The SDK can now handle linking multiple users to the same app.
- DBMetadata objects now have a "rev" field, which deprecates the old revision
  field.
- You can now load a list of past revisions for a file using
  loadRevisionsForFile: on DBRestClient. This call returns a list of DBMetadata
  objects that represent each revision. To restore the file to that state,
  you can call restoreFile:toRev:. You can also download the contents of the
  file at that state using loadFile:atRev:intoPath:.
- The upload call has been updated in several ways. First it takes an optional
  parentRev parameter, which indicates the parent version of the file you are
  uploading. If the file on the server does not have the same rev, it will
  spin off a conflicted copy with a different name. If you do not provide a rev,
  it will assume the file is new, and uploading to that file will spin off a
  conflicted copy if any file with the same name exists there. The upload
  DBRestClientDelegate callback also provides the metadata of the newly uploaded
  file, called restClient:uploadedFile:from:metadata:. The metadata will contain
  the path of the file if it is not the same as specified on upload due to
  conflicts.
- Searching the contents of the user's Dropbox is now possible using the
  searchPath:forKeyword: method on DBRestClient
- Generate links to files that can be shared with other users using the
  loadSharableLinkForFile: method on DBRestClient
- Get a link that can be used to stream audio and video for a limited amount of
  time using the loadStreamableURLForFile: method on DBRestClient
- Downloading a thumbnail of a .png or .gif will now download a .png instead of
  .jpeg to cut down on artifacts
- Various bug fixes


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
- Made DBLoginController compatibile with iOS 5


Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
DBRestClient.h:
- Various bug fixes
- Added a new upload callback that gives you the Dropbox path of the file that
  was just uploaded in addition to the source path.

DBSession.h:
- You can now get a callback when a request fails due to authentication error.
  Set yourself as the delegate to DBSession to get these events.
  For an example of how to implement this check out DBRouletteAppDelegate
  where it implements sessionDidReceiveAuthorizationFailure:


Changes from beta version in 0.1
README:
  - This file now has step-by-step instructions to getting started using the SDK

DropboxSDK.h:
  - A single file has been added that you can import to get all important SDK
    classes

DBRestClient:
  - initWithSession:root: has been deprecated. All apps are by default have
    full access.
  - The delegate response restClient:loadedMetadata: now returns a DBMetadata*
    object instead of a raw dictionary.
  - The possible delegate responses from loadMetadata:withHash: now includes
    restClient:metadataUnchangedAtPath: when no changes to the metadata has
    occurred since the last loadMetadata:withHash: call.
  - The delegate response restClient:loadedAccountInfo: now returns a
    DBAccountInfo* object.
  - The delegate response restClient:createdFolder: now returns a DBMetadata*
    object

DBLoginController:
  - This class has been added to provide a well designed login form with an easy
    to use interface for developers. It is recommended that you use it in your 
    app for the least amount of code and best user experience.
  - Simply create it and call [loginController presentFromController:self] to
    display on both iPhone and iPad
