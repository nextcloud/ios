All encrypted files and folders will be marked in orange colour. If they are in preview mode, they will be identified by a 3 bullets orange label instead.\n\nTemplates for recording your confidential data (note, payment card, ATM card, bank accounts, passwords to websites, etc…) are available and they can be saved in your Cloud in encrypted mode as well.\n\nActive/Disactive whenever you want, but remember to always use the same encryption key.\n\nAt the moment the encrypted files with Crypto Cloud System can be viewed only with iOS system.";
